# <a id="what-is-summarytools"></a>What is summarytools?

**summarytools** is an [R](https://r-project.org) package providing
functions to *neatly and quickly summarize data*. It can also make *R* a
little easier to learn and to use, especially for data cleaning and
preliminary analysis. Four functions are at its core:

| Function | Description |
|:--------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <a href="#freq">`freq()`</a> | **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative proportions and missing data information |
| <a href="#ctable">`ctable()`</a> | **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions, as well as marginal sums |
| <a href="#descr">`descr()`</a> | **descriptive (univariate) statistics** for numerical data |
| <a href="#dfsummary">`dfSummary()`</a> | Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate data cleaning and firsthand evaluation |

An emphasis has been put on both *what* and *how* results are presented,
so that the package can serve both as an exploration *and* a reporting
tool, used on its own for minimal reports, or with other packages such as
[rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
for more fine-tuned, elaborate reports.

**Building on the strengths of [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) and
[htmltools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools) summarytools** results
can be:

  - Sent to the *R* console as plain text (default behaviour)
  - Used in *Rmarkdown* documents and *knitted* along with other text and
    *R*-generated results
  - Written to *html* files that open up in
    [*RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/)’s Viewer or in a Web browser
  - Written to plain or *Rmarkdown* text files

It is also possible to use **summarytools** functions in *Shiny apps*.

### Latest Improvements

Version 0.9 brought **many** changes and improvements. A summary of those
changes can be found [near the end of this page](#latest-changes).
Changes specific to individual releases can be found in the
[NEWS](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools/blob/master/NEWS.md)
document.

## Installing summarytools

### Prerequisite Software

Windows users can skip this section.

Additional pieces of software are used by summarytools to fine-tune
graphics as well as provide some interactive features. If installing 
summarytools for the first time on your system, click on your OS to see the
relevant instructions on how to proceed. This takes only a few minutes.

### Installing summarytools From GitHub

This is the recommended method, as some minor fixes are made available
between CRAN releases.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("rapporter/pander") # Necessary for optimal results!
install_github("dcomtois/summarytools")
```


### Installing summarytools From CRAN

Simply run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("summarytools")
```


# Core Function #1: freq() (Frequency Tables)<a id="freq"></a>

The `freq()` function generates a frequency table with counts and
proportions, very similar to what SAS or SPSS users are accustomed to.

Since GitHub uses *markdown* rendering, we've set the
`style` argument to “rmarkdown”. When creating *Rmd* documents,
**knitr** takes care of converting the generated markup characters into
*html*.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

We've added the `plain.ascii` and `style` arguments for this first example;
however, since we have set these options globally using `st_options()`, they are not 
really needed. For this reason, we will not include them from hereon.

If we do not worry about missing data, we can set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

We can simplify further by omitting the *Totals* row, as well as 
the *cumulative* column:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, 
     cumul = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

To get familiar with the various output styles, try out different values for 
`style` -- “simple”, “rmarkdown” or “grid”.

### Subsetting Rows in Frequency Tables

The "rows" argument allows subsetting the resulting table; we can
use it in 3 different ways:

  - To select rows by position, we use a numerical vector; `rows = 1:10` will
    show the frequencies for the first 10 values only
  - To select rows by name, we either use
    + a character vector specifying row names
    + a single character string to be used as a regular expression;
      only the matching columns will be displayed
    
Used in combination with the "order" argument, this can be quite practical.
Say we have a character variable containing *many* distinct values; to see
only the 5 most frequent values, we simply use `order = "freq"` along with
`rows = 1:5`. Below is an example; notice the "(Other)" row -- it shows the
frequency of all the values not shown, which are lumped together.

```{r}
freq(tobacco$disease, order = "freq", rows = 1:5)
```

### Generating Several Frequency Tables at Once

There is more than one way to do this, but the simplest approach is to pass
the data frame object (subsetted if needed) to `freq()`: (results not shown)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco[ ,c("gender", "age.gr", "smoker")])
```

We can even feed the function with data frame containing numerous columns
of various data types; it will automatically discard numerical variables
having a large number of distinct values.

### Collapsible Sections

When generating an *html* document, use the `collapse = TRUE` argument with
`print()` or `view()` to get collapsible sections; clicking on the variable
name heading will collapse the frequency table for that variable (results
not shown).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(freq(tobacco), collapse = TRUE)
```


# Core Function #2: ctable() (Cross-Tabulations)<a id="ctable"></a>

We’ll now use a sample data frame called *tobacco*, included in
the package. We want to cross-tabulate two categorical variables:
`smoker` and `diseased`.

Since *markdown* does not (yet) support multiline headings, we’ll show a
rendered *html* version of the results:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(ctable(tobacco$smoker, tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"),
      method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-with-row-props.png" style="border:0"/>

The **knitr** chunk option `results` **needs to be set to “asis”**
to get properly formatted results.

By default, `ctable()` shows *row proportions*. To show column or total
proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`, respectively. To omit
proportions, use `prop = "n"`.

Now let's generate a simple “2 x 2” table (no proportions, no totals):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(smoker, diseased, prop = 'n', totals = FALSE),
     headings = FALSE, method = "render"))
```
<img src="img/ctable-barebones-2.png" style="border:0"/>

#### Chi-Square Results

To display chi-square results below the table, set `chisq = TRUE`. This time,
instead of `with()`, we'll use the `%$%` operator from the
**magrittr** package, which works in a very similar fashion.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
tobacco %$% 
  ctable(gender, smoker, chisq = TRUE, headings = FALSE) %>%
  print(method = "render")
```
<img src="img/ctable-chisq.png" style="border:0"  width=500px/>

Note that a warning will be issued when at least one *expected* cell
counts is lower than 5.


# Core Function #3: descr() (Descriptive / Univariate Statistics)<a id="descr"></a>

The `descr()` function generates common central tendency statistics and
measures of dispersion. It can handle single vectors
as well as data frames, in which case it ignores non-numerical
columns (displaying a message to that effect).

```{r}
descr(iris)
```

### Transposing, Selecting Statistics

If your eyes/brain prefer seeing things the other way around, just use
`transpose = TRUE`. Here, we also select only the statistics we wish to
see, and specify `headings = FALSE` to avoid reprinting the same
information as above.

We specify the stats we wish to report with the `stats` argument, which
also accepts values “all”, “fivenum”, and “common”. See `?descr` for a
complete list of available statistics.

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = "common", transpose = TRUE, headings = FALSE)
```

# Core Function #4: dfSummary() (Full-Fledged Data Summaries)<a id="dfsummary"></a>

`dfSummary()` collects information about all variables in a data frame and
displays it in a single legible table.

To generate a summary report and have it displayed in RStudio’s Viewer
pane (or in the default Web browser if working outside RStudio), we
simply do as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
![dfSummary Output displayed in RStudio’s viewer](img/dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png)

Of course, it is also possible to use `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown*
documents. It is usually a good idea to exclude a column or two,
otherwise the table might be a bit too wide. For instance, since the
*Valid* and *NA* columns are redundant, we can drop one of them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", 
          graph.magnif = 0.75, valid.col = FALSE, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp")
```

![dfSummary-rendered-markdown](img/dfSummary-render-in-markdown.png)

While rendering *html* tables with `view()` doesn't require it, here it is
essential to specify `tmp.img.dir`. We'll explain why [further below](#tmp-img-dir).

## Tidy Tables With tb()
When generating `freq()` or `descr()` tables, it is possible to turn the
results into "tidy" tables with the use of the `tb()` function (think of
*tb* as a diminutive for *tibble*). For example:

```{r, results='markup'}
library(magrittr)
iris %>% descr(stats = "common") %>% tb()
iris$Species %>% freq(cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE) %>% tb()
```

By definition, no total rows are part of *tidy* tables, and row.names are
converted to regular columns. 

## Tidy Split-Group Statistics

Here are two examples of how lists created using `stby()` are
transformed into *tibbles*. Notice how the *order* parameter affects the
table’s row ordering:

```{r, results='markup'}
grouped_freqs <- stby(data = tobacco$smoker, INDICES = tobacco$gender,
                      FUN = freq, cumul = FALSE, report.nas = FALSE)
grouped_freqs %>% tb()
grouped_freqs %>% tb(order = 2)

grouped_descr <- stby(data = exams, INDICES = exams$gender, 
                      FUN = descr, stats = "common")
grouped_descr %>% tb()
grouped_descr %>% tb(order = 2)
```

# The print() and view() Functions

**summarytools** has a generic `print` method, `print.summarytools()`. By
default, its `method` argument is set to “pander”. One of the ways in
which `view()` is useful is that we can use it to easily display *html*
outputs in *RStudio*’s Viewer. The `view()` function simply acts as a
wrapper around `print.summarytools()`, specifying `method = 'viewer'`.
When used outside *RStudio*, `method` falls back to “browser” and the
report is shown in the default browser.

# Using stby() to Ventilate Results

We can use `stby()` the same way as *R*’s base function `by()` with the
four core **summarytools** functions. This returns a list-type object
containing as many elements as there are categories in the grouping
variable.

**Why not just use `by()`?** The reason is that `by()` creates objects
of class "by()", which have a dedicated `print()` method conflicting
with summarytools' way of printing list-type objects. Since `print.by()`
can't be redefined (as of CRAN policies), the sensible solution was to
introduce a function that is essentially a clone of `by()`, except that
the objects it creates have the class "stby", allowing the desired
flexibility.

Using the *iris* data frame, we will now display descriptive statistics
by Species.

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), 
                               transpose = TRUE))
```

To see an *html* version of these results, we simply use `view()` (also
possible is to use `print()` with `method = "viewer"`):  (results not shown)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species)
# or
print(iris_stats_by_species, method = "viewer")
```

A special situation occurs when we want grouped statistics *for one
variable only*. Instead of showing several tables, each having one 
column, **summarytools** assembles everything into a single table:

```{r}
data(tobacco)
with(tobacco, stby(BMI, age.gr, descr, 
                        stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
```

**The transposed version looks like this:**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   stby(BMI, age.gr, descr,  transpose = TRUE,
                        stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
print(BMI_by_age, headings = FALSE)
```

### Using stby() With ctable()

This is a little trickier -- the working syntax is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), tobacco$gender, ctable)
# or equivalently
with(tobacco, stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), gender, ctable))
```

## Using dplyr::group_by() to Ventilate Results

To create grouped statistics with `descr()` or `dfSummary()`, it is possible
to use **dplyr**’s `group_by()` as an alternative to `stby()`. Aside from the
syntactic differences, one key distinction is that `dplyr::group_by()` considers
`NA` values on the grouping variables as valid categories, albeit with a warning
message suggesting to use `forcats::fct_explicit_na` to make `NA`’s explicit.
The best way to go is to actually follow that advice:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
tobacco$gender <- forcats::fct_explicit_na(tobacco$gender)
tobacco %>% group_by(gender) %>% descr(stats = "fivenum")
```

## Using summarytools in Rmarkdown Documents

As we have seen, **summarytools** can generate both text/*markdown* and
*html* results. Both types of outputs can be used in Rmarkdown documents.
The vignette
[Recommendations for Using summarytools With Rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=summarytools/vignettes/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html)
provides good guidelines, but here are a few tips to get started:

 - Always set the `knitr` chunk option `results = 'asis'`. You can do
   this on a chunk-by-chunk basis, but it is easier to just set it globally
   in a "setup" chunk:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'asis')
```

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Refer to [this page](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for
more **knitr** options.

  - To get better results when generating *html* output with `method = 'render'`,
    set up your *.Rmd* document so that it includes **summarytools**’ css. The
    `st_css()` function makes this very easy.

#### Initial Setup -- Example

````
# ---
# title: "RMarkdown using summarytools"
# output: html_document
# ---
#
# ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(comment = NA, prompt = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis')
# library(summarytools)
# st_options(plain.ascii = FALSE,          # This is a must in Rmd documents
#            style = "rmarkdown",          # idem
#            dfSummary.varnumbers = FALSE, # This keeps results narrow enough
#            dfSummary.valid.col = FALSE)  # idem
#```
#
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# st_css()
# ```
````

Since `results = 'asis'` can conflict with other packages' way of generating
results, it is sometimes best to use it for individual chunks only.

### Managing Lengthy dfSummary() Outputs in Rmarkdown Documents

For data frames containing numerous variables, we can use the `max.tbl.height`
argument to wrap the results in a scrollable window having the specified
height, in pixels. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco, valid.col = FALSE, graph.magnif = 0.75), 
      max.tbl.height = 300, method = "render")
```

![dfSummary-scroll-window](img/dfSummary-scroll-window.png)

## Writing Output to Files

We can use the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()` to indicate that we
want to save the results in a file, be it *html*, *Rmd*, *md*, or just plain
text (*txt*). The file extension indicates to **summarytools** what type of file
should be generated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

## Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if you want to include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating an *.Rmd* document.

## Generating PDF’s

There is no direct way to create a *PDF* with **summarytools**. There are however
several tools that allow converting *html* documents into *PDF*’s. The most widely
used is most probably [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), but for converting 
`dfSummary()` tables, better results can be achieved using
[WK<html>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html).

### Example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/R")
library(summarytools)
print(dfSummary(iris), file = "iris_dfs.html")
system("wkhtmltopdf --javascript-delay 1 iris_dfs.html iris_dfs.pdf")
shell.exec("iris_dfs.pdf")        # Windows
system("xdg-open 'iris_dfs.pdf'") # Linux
system("open 'iris_dfs.pdf'")     # OS X
```

Note that on *Windows* systems, after installing [WK<html>TOpdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html),
we need to add `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin` to the PATH environment variable.
 
For fine-tuned, multi-paged reports, a sensible approach would be to first use
*Rmarkdown*, perhaps in combination with RStudio’s [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)
package if pagination is desired, to generate an *html* document that will lend 
itself easily to a *PDF* conversion.

#### Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_options()                      # display all global options values
st_options('round.digits')        # display the value of a specific option
st_options(style = 'rmarkdown')   # change one or several options' values
st_options(footnote = NA)         # Turn off the footnote on all outputs.
                                  # This option was used prior to generating
                                  # the present document.
```

## Overriding formatting attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` method or the `view()` function.

### Overriding Function-Specific Arguments


| Argument       | freq   | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -------------: | :----: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| style          |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| round.digits   |   x    |   x    |   x   |           |
| plain.ascii    |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| justify        |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| headings       |   x    |   x    |   x   |     x     |

#### Example 

Here’s an example in which we override 3 function-specific arguments, and one
element of the heading:

```{r}
(age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)) 
print(age_stats, report.nas = FALSE, totals = FALSE, display.type = FALSE,
      Variable.label = "Age Group")
```

Note that the original attributes are still part of the *age\_stats* object,
left unchanged.

## Order of Priority for Options / Parameters

1.  Options overridden explicitly in `print()` or `view()` have
    precedence
2.  Options specified as explicit arguments to `freq() / ctable() /
    descr() / dfSummary()` come second
3.  Global options set with `st_options` come third

## Customizing looks with CSS

**summarytools** uses *RStudio*’s
[htmltools package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)
and version 4 of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)’s cascading
stylesheets.

It is possible to include your own *css* if you wish to customize the
look of the output tables. See `?print.summarytools` for all the details,
but here is a quick example.

Say you need to make the font size really really small. For this,
you would create a *.css* file - let’s call it “custom.css” -
containing a class definition such as the following:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```
Then, to apply it to a **summarytools** object and display it in your
browser:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
     table.classes = 'tiny-text')
```

To display a smaller table that is not **that** small, you can use the
**provided css class `st-small`**.

## Working with *Shiny* apps

To include **summarytools** functions in *Shiny* apps, it is recommended that 
you:

 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app’s layout  
 - omit headings by setting the global option `headings = FALSE`
 - adjust the size of the graphs in `dfSummary()` using the `dfSummary.graph.magnif`
   global option
 - if `dfSummary()` outputs are too wide, try omitting a column or two
   (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`, for instance)
 - if needed, set the column widths manually with the `col.widths` parameter of the 
   `print()` method or the `view()` function
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

## Graphs in Markdown dfSummaries<a id="tmp-img-dir"></a>

When generating *markdown* (as opposed to *html*) summaries in an *.Rmd* document,
three elements are needed to display proper *png* graphs:

  1 - `plain.ascii` is FALSE  
  2 - `style` is "grid"  
  3 - `tmp.img.dir` is defined  

Why the third element? Although *R* makes it really easy to 
create temporary files and directories, they do have long pathnames,
especially on Windows. Combine this with the fact that Pandoc currently
determines the final (rendered) column widths by counting characters, 
including those of pathnames pointing to images. What we get is... some
issues of proportion (!). 

At this time, there seems to be only one solution around this problem:
cut down on characters in pathnames. So instead of this:
```
+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Variable  | Graph                                                                   | Valid   |
+===========+=========================================================================+=========+
| gender\   | ![](C:/Users/johnny/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpYRgetx/file5aa4549a4d71.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]  |                                                                         | (97.8%) |
+----+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
```

...we aim for this:
```
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
| Variable      | Graph                | Valid   |
+===============+======================+=========+
| gender\       | ![](/tmp/ds0001.png) | 978\    |
| [factor]      |                      | (97.8%) |
+---------------+----------------------+---------+
```

Now CRAN policies are really strict when it comes to writing content in 
the user directories, or anywhere outside *R’s temporary zone* (for good 
reasons). So we need to let the users set this location themselves,
therefore implicitly consenting to content being written outside
*R’s temporary zone*.

On Mac OS and Linux, using "/tmp" makes a lot of sense: it’s short, and
it’s self-cleaning. On Windows, there is no such convenient directory, so
we need to pick one -- be it absolute ("/tmp") or relative ("img",
or simply "."). Two things are to be kept in mind: it needs to be short
(5 characters max) and we need to clean it up manually.

## Translations

It is now possible to change the language used in the outputs. The following
languages are available, thanks to the R community’s efforts:
French (*fr*), Portuguese (*pt*), Russian (*ru*), Spanish (*es*), and
Turkish (*tr*).

### Switching Languages

To switch languages, simply use 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_options(lang = "fr")
```

Any function will now produce outputs using that language:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(freq(iris$Species))
```


<img style="float: center;" src="img/freq-fr.png" width=500px />

The language used for producing the object is stored within it as an attribute.
This is to avoid problems when switching languages between the moment the 
object is stored, and the moment at which it is printed.

### Non-UTF-8 Locales

On most Windows systems, it will be necessary to change the `LC_CTYPE` element
of the locale settings if the character set is not included in the current
locale. For instance, in order to get good results -- or rather, any results at
all -- with the Russian language in a "latin1" environment, we'll need to do
this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "russian")
st_options(lang = 'ru')
```

Then, to go back to default settings:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "")
st_options(lang = "en")
```

## Defining and Using Custom Translations

Using the function `use_custom_lang()`, it is possible to add your own set of 
translations. To achieve this, get the 
[*csv* template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv),
customize the +/- 70 items, and call `use_custom_lang()`, giving it as
sole argument the path to your edited *csv* file. Note that such
custom translations will not persist across R sessions. This means that
you should always have this *csv* file handy.

## Defining Specific Keywords

Sometimes, all you might want to do is change just a few keywords -- say you
would rather have "N" instead of "Freq" in the title row of `freq()` tables. No
need to create a full custom language for that. Rather, use `define_keywords()`.
Calling this function without any arguments will bring up, on systems that
support graphical devices (the vast majority, that is), an editable window
allowing the modify only the desired items. 

![define_keywords](img/define_keywords.png)

After closing the edit window, you will be offered to export the resulting
"custom language" into a *csv* file that can be imported later on with
`use_custom_lang()`.

Note that it is also possible to define one or several keywords using function
arguments. For the list of all possible keywords to define, see `?define_keywords`.
For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
define_keywords(freq = "N")
```

## Latest Changes and Improvements<a id="latest-changes"></a>

As stated earlier, version 0.9 brought many changes and improvements.
Here are the main ones:

 - **Translations**
 - **Improved printing of list objects**
   + Objects of class “stby” are automatically printed in the console with
     optimal results; no more need for `view(x, method = "pander")`;
     simply use `stby()` instead of `by()`
   + Regular lists containing **summarytools** objects can also be printed with
     optimal results simply by calling `print(x)` (as opposed to “stby” objects,
     their automatic printing will **not** be optimal; that being said, `freq()`
     now accepts data frames as its first argument, so the need for `lapply()`
     is greatly diminished)
 - **Easier management of global settings with `st_options()`**
   + `st_options()` now has as many parameters as there are
     options to set, making it possible to set all options 
     with only one function call; legacy way of setting
     options is still supported
   + Several global options were added, with a focus on simplifying 
     *Rmarkdown* document creation
 - **improved magrittr** operators support (`%>%`, `%$%`)
 - **Changes to `freq()`**
   + As mentioned earlier, the function now accepts data frames as its main 
     argument; this makes practically obsolete the use of `lapply()` with it
   + Improved outputs when using `stby()`
 - **Changes to `ctable()`**
   + Fully supports `stby()`
   + Improved number alignment
   + Added "chisq" parameter
 - **Changes to `descr()`**
   + For the `stats` argument, Values “fivenum” and “common” are now allowed,
     the latter representing the collection of *mean*, *sd*, *min*, *med*,
     *max*, *n.valid*, and *pct.valid*
   + Improved outputs when using `stby()` 
   + The variable used for weights (if any) is removed automatically from the
     data so no stats are produced for it
 - **Changes to `dfSummary()`**
   + Now fully compatible with *Rmarkdown* with its *png* graphs
   + Number of columns is included in the heading section
   + Number of duplicated rows is also shown in the heading section
   + Bar plots now more accurately reflect counts, as they are not stretched
     across table cells (this allows comparison of frequencies across 
     variables)
   + Columns with particular content (unary/binary, integer sequences, UPC/EAN
     codes) are treated differently; more relevant information is displayed,
     while irrelevant information is hidden
   + For *html* outputs, a new parameter `col.widths` can be used to set the
     width of the resulting table’s columns; this addresses an issue
     with some graphs not being shown at the desired magnification level 
     (although much effort has been put into improving this as well)
   + `max.tbl.height` parameter added, allowing lengthy summaries to
     be shown in a scrollable window

### Other Notable Changes

 - The `omit.headings` parameter has been replaced by the more straightforward
   (and still boolean) `headings`. `omit.heandings` is deprecated as of 0.9.4.
 - Because it was subject to errors, the *Rows Subset* heading element
   has been removed. If there is a strong need for it, I can bring it back in a 
   future release (just let me known by email or on GitHub if you'd like to have
   it back)
 - Under the hood, much has been going on; the lengthier functions have been
   split into more manageable parts, and several normalizing operations were
   performed, facilitating maintenance and improving code readability
 - The `tb()` function turns results from `freq()` and `descr()` into 
   *tidy tibbles*
